## Key Functions

### **Booking Management**
```typescript
// Check if booking can be cancelled (>24 hours)
const canCancelBooking = (booking: Booking) => {
  const hoursDifference = (booking.date.getTime() - now.getTime()) / (1000 * 60 * 60);
  return hoursDifference > 24;
};

// Cancel a booking
const handleCancelBooking = () => {
  setBookings(bookings.map(b => 
    b.id === selectedBooking.id 
      ? { ...b, status: 'cancelled' }
      : b
  ));
};
```

### **Calendar Utilities**
```typescript
// Get all days in a month with proper grid alignment
const getMonthDays = (date: Date) => {
  // Returns array including empty slots for alignment
};

// Get bookings for a specific date
const getBookingsForDate = (date: Date | null) => {
  return bookings.filter(b => 
    b.date matches date && b.status === 'upcoming'
  );
};
```

### **Filtering**
```typescript
// Separate upcoming and past bookings
const upcomingBookings = bookings
  .filter(b => b.status === 'upcoming')
  .sort((a, b) => a.date - b.date);

const pastBookings = bookings
  .filter(b => b.status === 'completed' || b.status === 'cancelled')
  .sort((a, b) => b.date - a.date);
```

## Backend Requirements

### **Database Tables Needed**

```sql
-- Bookings table
CREATE TABLE bookings (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id),
  instructor_id UUID REFERENCES instructors(id),
  lesson_type TEXT NOT NULL,
  booking_date TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  booking_time TEXT NOT NULL,
  duration TEXT NOT NULL,
  skill_level TEXT NOT NULL,
  focus_areas TEXT[] NOT NULL,
  additional_notes TEXT,
  price INTEGER NOT NULL,
  status TEXT CHECK (status IN ('upcoming', 'completed', 'cancelled')),
  cancellation_reason TEXT,
  cancelled_at TIMESTAMP,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_bookings_user_id ON bookings(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_bookings_instructor_id ON bookings(instructor_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_bookings_date ON bookings(booking_date);
CREATE INDEX idx_bookings_status ON bookings(status);
```

### **API Endpoints Needed**

```typescript
// Get user's bookings
GET /api/bookings?userId={userId}&status={status}

// Get specific booking
GET /api/bookings/{bookingId}

// Create new booking
POST /api/bookings
Body: { userId, instructorId, lessonType, date, time, ... }

// Cancel booking
PATCH /api/bookings/{bookingId}/cancel
Body: { cancellationReason }

// Update booking (reschedule)
PATCH /api/bookings/{bookingId}
Body: { date, time, ... }
